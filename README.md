# Generative Art - Rain of Stars ✨

A creative JavaScript project that generates a full-screen "rain of stars" animation using **p5.js**. Stars fall from the top, and users can add new stars by clicking the mouse.

## 🚀 Features
- Fullscreen animation with stars of random sizes and speeds.
- Semi-transparent background for a "trailing" effect.
- **Interactive:** Click to add new stars at the cursor position.
- **Dynamic resizing:** Automatically adjusts to window size changes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **p5.js** – JavaScript library for drawing and animation (included via CDN).
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – No additional frameworks.
- **HTML/CSS** – Simple structure and minimal styling.

## 📌 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Druid45ra/generative-art.git
   ```
2. **Open the project folder:**
   Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

   - No local server required, works directly from the file.
   - Click anywhere on the screen to add new stars.
   - Maximize the window (or press `F11`) for the full effect.

## 💡 Ideas for Enhancements
- Add star trails using `stroke()` for a meteor effect.
- Control star speed using arrow keys.
- Experiment with dynamic colors or different shapes (triangles, squares, etc.).
